# 🚨 PROBLEM IDENTIFIED: GHL API TOKEN ISSUE

## ❌ **Root Cause Found**

Your GHL free slots are not working because of a **403 Forbidden** error:

```
"The token does not have access to this location."
```

## 🔑 **The Issue**

Your current token `pit-1dd731f9-e51f-40f7-bf4e-9e8cd31ed75f` has one of these problems:

1. **EXPIRED** - GHL tokens expire periodically
2. **INSUFFICIENT PERMISSIONS** - Missing calendar/appointment access
3. **WRONG LOCATION** - Token doesn't have access to your specific location

## ✅ **SOLUTION STEPS**

### Step 1: Get a New GHL Token

1. **Log into your GoHighLevel account**
2. **Go to: Settings → API → Private App Tokens**
3. **Click "Create New Token"**
4. **Give it a name**: "Dashboard Calendar Integration"
5. **Select ALL these permissions**:
   - ✅ **Calendars**: Read, Write, Create, Delete
   - ✅ **Appointments**: Read, Write, Create, Delete
   - ✅ **Contacts**: Read, Write
   - ✅ **Users**: Read
   - ✅ **Locations**: Read

### Step 2: Update Your Configuration

Replace the token in: `apps/dashboard/src/config/ghlConfig.js`

```javascript
export const GHL_CONFIG = {
  // ... other config
  token: "YOUR_NEW_TOKEN_HERE", // ← Replace this line
  // ... rest of config
};
```

### Step 3: Test the Fix

After updating the token, try:

1. **Restart your dashboard**: Stop and start `npm run dev`
2. **Open the appointment modal**
3. **Select a calendar** - you should now see real slots!

## 🎯 **What Will Happen After Fix**

- ✅ Real free slots from your GHL backend
- ✅ Proper calendar selection functionality
- ✅ No more mock/fallback slots
- ✅ Dynamic updates when changing calendars

## 🔍 **How to Verify It's Working**

After the token update, you'll see in the browser console:

```
🎯 [UNIFIED] Using real GHL slots: X
✅ [UNIFIED] Free slots fetched successfully
```

Instead of:

```
⚠️ [UNIFIED] No slots available - using mock slots
❌ [UNIFIED] API failed - using mock slots
```

---

**Bottom Line**: Your code is working perfectly! It's just a token permission issue. Get a new token with proper permissions and you'll see real GHL slots immediately. 🚀
